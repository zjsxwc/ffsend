# ffsend [WIP]
> Easily and securely share files from the command line.
> A fully featured [Firefox Send][send] client.

Easily and securely share files and directories from the command line through a
safe, private and encrypted link using a single simple command.
Files are shared using the [Send][send] service and may be up
to 2GB. Others are able to download these files with this tool, or through
their webbrowser.

[![ffsend usage demo][usage-demo-svg]][usage-demo-asciinema]  
_No demo visible here? View it on [asciinema][usage-demo-asciinema]._

All files are always encrypted on the client, and secrets are never shared with
the remote host. An optional password may be specified, and a default file
lifetime of 1 (up to 20) download or 24 hours is enforced to ensure your stuff
does not remain online forever.
This provides a secure platform to share your files.

Use the `--help` flag, `help` subcommand, or see the [help](#help) section for
all available subcommands.

## Requirements
- Linux, macOS or Windows
- A terminal :sunglasses:
- Linux specific:
  - `xclip` for clipboard support (optional)
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install xclip`
    - CentOS/Red Hat/openSUSE/Fedora: `yum install xclip`
    - Arch: `pacman -S xclip`
- Internet connection for uploading and downloading

## Install
<!-- Before installing, make sure you meet all requirements listed
[here](#requirements) -->

Because `ffsend` is still in alpha, only limited installation options are
available right now.  

A set of pre-build binaries for Linux and macOS can be found as asset of the
[latest release][github-latest-release]. When downloading such release, mark
the binary as executable using `chmod a+x ffsend`, and move it into `/usr/bin/`.

A Windows binary and packaged versions for various Linux distributions is
currently being worked on.

It is recommended to build and install `ffsend` yourself using these fairly
easy steps [here](#build).

## Build
To build and install `ffsend` yourself, you meet the following requirements
before proceeding:

### Build requirements
- Regular [requirements](#requirements)
- [`git`][git]
- [`rust`][rust] `v1.26` or higher (install using [`rustup`][rustup])
- [OpenSSL][openssl] or [LibreSSL][libressl] libraries and headers must be available
	- Linux:
		- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install pkg-config libssl-dev`
		- CentOS/Red Hat/openSUSE: `yum install openssl-devel`
		- Arch: `pacman -S openssl`
		- Fedora: `dnf install openssl-devel`
		- Or see instructions [here](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl#linux)
	- macOS:
		- Using `brew`: `brew install openssl`
		- Or see instructions [here](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl#osx)
	- Windows:
		- See instructions here [here](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl#windows-msvc)

### Compile and install
Then, walk through one of the following steps to compile and install `ffsend`:

- Compile and install it directly from cargo:

	```bash
	# Compile and install from cargo
	cargo install ffsend -f

	# Start using ffsend
	ffsend --help
	```

- Or clone the repository and install it with `cargo`:

	```bash
	# Clone the project
	git clone https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend.git
	cd ffsend

	# Compile and install
	cargo install -f

	# Start using ffsend
	ffsend --help

	# or run it directly from cargo
	cargo run --release -- --help 
	```

- Or clone the repository and invoke the binary directly (Linux/macOS):

	```bash
	# Clone the project
	git clone https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend.git
	cd ffsend

	# Build the project (release version)
	cargo build --release

	# Start using ffsend
	./target/release/ffsend --help
	``` 

### Compile features / use flags
Different use flags are available for `ffsend` to toggle whether to include
various features.
The following features are available, some of which are enabled by default:

| Feature     | Enabled | Description                                                |
| :---------: | :-----: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clipboard` | Default | Support for copying links to the clipboard                 |
| `history`   | Default | Support for tracking files in history                      |
| `archive`   | Default | Support for archiving and extracting uploads and downloads |
| `no-color`  |         | Compile without color support in error and help messages   |

To enable features during building or installation, specify them with
`--features <features, >` when using `cargo`.
You may want to disable alisl default features first using
`--no-default-features`.
Here are some examples:

```bash
# Defaults set of features with no-color, one of
cargo install --features no-color
cargo build --release --features no-color

# None of the features
cargo install --no-default-features

# Only history and clipboard support
cargo install --no-default--features --features history,clipboard
```

## Configuration and environment
The following environment variables may be used to configure the following
defaults. The CLI flag is shown along with it, to better describe the relation
to command line arguments:

| Variable         | CLI flag           | Description       |
| :--------------- | :----------------: | :---------------- |
| `FFSEND_HISTORY` | `--history <FILE>` | History file path |
| `FFSEND_HOST`    | `--host <URL>`     | Upload host       |

These environment variables may be used to toggle a flag, simply by making them
available. The actual value of these variables is ignored, and variables may be
empty.

| Variable             | CLI flag        | Description                       |
| :------------------- | :-------------: | :-------------------------------- |
| `FFSEND_FORCE`       | `--force`       | Force operations                  |
| `FFSEND_NO_INTERACT` | `--no-interact` | No interaction for prompts        |
| `FFSEND_YES`         | `--yes`         | Assume yes for prompts            |
| `FFSEND_INCOGNITO`   | `--incognito`   | Incognito mode, don't use history |
| `FFSEND_OPEN`        | `--open`        | Open share link of uploaded file  |
| `FFSEND_ARCHIVE`     | `--archive`     | Archive files uploaded            |
| `FFSEND_EXTRACT`     | `--extract`     | Extract files downloaded          |
| `FFSEND_COPY`        | `--copy`        | Copy share link to clipboard      |
| `FFSEND_VERBOSE`     | `--verbose`     | Log verbose information           |

At this time, no configuration or _dotfile_ file support is available.
This will be something added in a later release.

## Security
In short; the `ffsend` tool and the [Send][send] service can be considered
secure, and may be used to share sensitive files. Note though that the
created share link for an upload will allow anyone to download the file. 
Make sure you don't share this link with unauthorized people.

For more detailed information on encryption, please read the rest of the
paragraphs in this security section.

_Note: even though the encryption method is considered secure, this `ffsend`
tool does not provide any warranty in any way, shape or form for files that
somehow got decrypted without proper authorization._

#### Client side encryption
`ffsend` uses client side encryption, to ensure your files are securely
encrypted before they are uploaded to the remote host. This makes it impossible
for third parties to decrypt your file without having the secret (encryption
key). The file and it's metadata are encrypted using `128-bit AES-GCM`, and a
`HMAC SHA-256` signing key is used for request authentication.
This is consistent with the encryption documentation provided by the
[Send][send] service, `ffsend` is a tool for.

A detailed list on the encryption/decryption steps, and on what encryption is
exactly used can be found [here][send-encryption] in the official service
documentation.

#### Note on share link security
The encryption secret, that is used to decrypt the file when downloading,
is included in the share URL behind the `#` (hash). This secret is never sent
the remote server directly when using the share link in your browser.
It would be possible however for a webpage to load some malicious JavaScript
snippet that eventually steals the secret from the link once the page is loaded.
Although this scenario is extremely unlikely, there are some options to prevent
this from happening:

- Only use this `ffsend` tool, do not use the share link in your browser.
- Add additional protection by specifying a password using `--password` while
  uploading, or using the `password` subcommand afterwards.
- Host a secure [Send][send] service instance yourself.

A complete overview on encryption can be found in the official service
documentation [here][send-encryption].
